I think Iâ€™m very lucky to be healthy and born in a country thatâ€™s not at war which allows me to be who I really want to be.

Iâ€™m always grateful to my parents, family and friends for their love and support. Iâ€™m neither rich or poor but as everyone I want to be happy.

**Itâ€™s been already 25 years since I was born, so why is my journey just beginning ?**

Itâ€™s because after all this time, Iâ€™m feeling free and released.
Iâ€™ve always lived paying attention to others expectations and social standards in order to be accepted by everyone.

When I was a teenager I knew something was wrong.

I didnâ€™t like big parties, unpredictable events like surprise, unhealthy small talk and be around too much people that I didnâ€™t feel any connection with. I didnâ€™t like crowded environments, they tired me and I tried to escape them.

Well, it seems like I was more an introverted person than extrovert. But I didnâ€™t know these words until my twenties. Thatâ€™s when I started exploring further the subject of personal development.

I was living a life through the flow of events, a passive life as a spectator. To be honest, it was a very comfortable and nothing is wrong with that.

**But my soul was empty.**

I discovered that materialistic things can cause a spark of life in me but itâ€™s only for a moment. Then I wanted to ignite it again and grow it stronger than before. Before I realized it, I was trapped in a vicious cycle to pursue and consume more things to sustain this fleeting feeling of happiness.

This lifestyle was symply crazy for me. Luckily, I was able to quickly get out of that cycle and find others means to feel alive.

The answers for me were simple yet it took me many years of research and self reflection to find it.

1. I found that I'm fine as I am now. I can finally make peace with myself and the world around me.

2. I want to build meaningful and longtime relationship with people I care.

3. I realized the importance of sharing my passion and using my skills in order to help people who may need it.

4. Lastly, I discovered that having a purpose, a goal thatâ€™s beyond myself challenge me to reach my full potential.

**Thatâ€™s why my true journey begins now.**

I want to be happy through myself, with others and the world without giving up on my integrity and values. ðŸ˜„ 

Through this blog, I will post anything I want as I write for myself, but if you find value in it then thatâ€™s a super bonus and I wish you the best in your own adventure.

My journey is selfish and I consider myself as a selfish person.

The funny thing is that my selfishness leads to what we can call altruism as I sincerely want to help people who may find something worth to their own life through my journey.
